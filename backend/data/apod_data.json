        "explanation": "\n Explanation: \nWhy does the shadow of this volcano look like a triangle?\n\nThe Mount Teide volcano itself does not have the strictly\npyramidal shape\nthat its geometric shadow might suggest.  \n\nThe triangle shadow phenomena is not unique to the\nMt. Teide, though, and is\ncommonly\nseen from the tops of other\nlarge mountains and volcanoes.\n\nA key reason for the strange dark shape is that the observer is looking down the long corridor of a sunset (or sunrise) shadow that extends to the horizon.\n\nEven if the\nhuge volcano were a perfect\ncube \nand the resulting shadow were a long rectangular box, \nthat box would appear to taper off at its top as its\nshadow extended far into the distance, just as parallel\ntrain tracks do.\n\nThe featured spectacular image shows\nPico Viejo crater in the foreground, located on\nTenerife in the\nCanary Islands of\nSpain.\n\nThe nearly full moon is seen nearby shortly after its\ntotal lunar eclipse.\n\n",

Clarke.\n\nLike Rama, 'Oumuamua is \nunusually elongated, \nshould be made of strong material to avoid breaking apart, is \nonly passing through our Solar System, \nand passed unusually close to the Sun for something gravitationally unbound.\n\nUnlike a visiting spaceship, though, 'Oumuamua's \ntrajectory, \nspeed, color, and even \nprobability of detection \nare consistent with it forming naturally around a \nnormal star many millions of years ago, \nbeing expelled after gravitationally encountering a \nnormal planet, \nand subsequently orbiting in our Galaxy alone.\n\nEven given \n'Oumuamua's \nlikely conventional origin, perhaps \nhumanity can hold hope that one day we will have the technology to engineer 'Oumuamua -- or another Solar System interloper -- into an interstellar Rama of our own.\n\n\n",

## Project Overview


The original APOD website by NASA delivers awe-inspiring astronomical images and descriptions on a daily basis. However, its interface, though informative, can feel outdated. Navigating through the website often involves clicking on multiple links to access images, which can be time-consuming and less user-friendly. This project aims to bring a fresh look and fell to the website and enhances user interaction. Our goal is to provide a seamless and visually pleasing way for users to explore and enjoy the cosmos effortlessly.

Using the power of `BeautifulSoup`, this project scrapes data from NASA's official APOD website, extracting images, titles, explanations, and other relevant information. The redesigned web application offers various pages and features to enhance user engagement.

## Features

1. **Home Page - Gallery:** Browse through an extensive gallery of astronomical images.

2. **Today's Picture:** Get the astronomy picture that was uploaded today.

3. **Trending Page:** Explore the popular images that have captured the imagination of space enthusiasts.

4. **Favorites Page:** View your favorite images that you liked.

5. **User Authentication:** Sign up and log in to the website.

6. **Image Interaction:**
   - **Like Images:** Express your appreciation for images by liking them.
   - **Download Images:** Download high-quality versions of the images for offline enjoyment.
